## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gather and analyze the weather temperature trends of June and December for Oahu, Hawaii for our friend W. Avy who dreams of opening an Ice Cream parlor and surfing year round. Our statistical analysis will help W. Avy determine if their dream ice cream business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
### June Temperature Results
From the 1,700 ovservations in June 2010 to June 2017, we can identify the mean, minumum, and maximum temperature; as well as the standard deviation. As seen below, the std of 3.26 degrees shows June has a very consistent temperature for the previous seven years. The June results are exactly what W. Avy should hope for, consistent temperatures with minimal fluctuation supports his dream ice cream business. Results can be seen below:

### December Temperature Results
Although December had 11% less observations than June, 1,517 observations ranging from December 2010 to December 2017 is plenty to work with. We can identify the mean, minimum, and maximum temperature for the previous seven years, which also support W. Avy's dream. December had a slightly higher std, 3.75; however, there is minimal fluctuation across the month and suddenly Oahu, Hawaii presents itself as an enticing ice cream business location. Results can be seen below:

### June vs December Results
**June has consistently warmer temperatures than December

**Junes minimum temperature (64) is 8 degrees warmer than Decembers (56)

**Junes mean temperature (74.9) is 3.86 degrees warmer than Decembers mean temperature (71.04)

**Junes maximum temperature (85) is 2 degrees higher than Decembers (83)


### Summary
Comparing June & December shows that Oahu has very minimal temperature fluctuation throughout the year, which certainly supports W. Avy's dream but doesn't cover the entire weather scope. Two additional queries to include in futher research should be morning vs evening weather splits, and precipitation levels. 

As with any business, identifying "busy" hours is essential for longevity, which is why researching the morning vs evening temperature trends in Oahu should be included in further research. While temperatures have shown to be consistent thus far, we haven't pin-pointed the ideal hours of operation, the highest temperature time of day where customers crave ice cream. By gathering this information, W. Avy can identify when the "peak" hours are temperature wise, and develop their hours of operation around that. Solidifying these hours based on weather statistics will minimize the amount of downtime or lower traffic the stand will receive, and makes the most of the resouces while in use.

An additional query to consider for further research is precipitation levels in Oahu. Once we've gathered participation statistics, W. Avy can determine if there is a rain season in Oahu which would impact the businesses year round sustainability. Also, this information could determine the ideal location for stand(s) in Oahu, certain areas of the island will experience less precipitation than others, and W. Avy can prioritize those locations to minimize all weather risks and maximize profits.
